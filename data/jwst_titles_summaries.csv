Webb Captures Top of Iconic Horsehead Nebula in Unprecedented Detail,"Webb’s new view focuses on the illuminated edge of the nebula’s distinctive structure. The Horsehead Nebula is prancing across the cosmic stage in new infrared views from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. Extreme close-ups of the horse’s “mane” from Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) showcase a dynamic region that transitions from a mostly neutral, warm area of gas and dust within the nebula (represented in blue) to surrounding hot, ionized gas (red). Webb’s observations will allow astronomers to investigate how dust in the nebula blocks and emits light, and to better understand the nebula’s shape."
NASA's Webb Maps Weather on Planet 280 Light-Years Away,"WASP-43 b is cloudy on the nightside and clear on the dayside, with equatorial winds howling around the planet at 5,000 miles per hour. Sometimes not finding something is just as exciting and useful as finding it. Take hot Jupiter WASP-43 b, for example. This tidally locked world has a searing-hot, permanent dayside and a somewhat cooler nightside. Astronomers using Webb to map the temperature and analyze the atmosphere around the planet expected to detect methane, a common carbon molecule, on the nightside. But there is clearly no sign of it. Why? The result suggests that supersonic winds of hot gas are blowing around from the dayside, thoroughly churning up the atmosphere, and preventing the chemical reactions that would otherwise produce methane on the nightside."
NASA's Webb Hints at Possible Atmosphere Surrounding Rocky Exoplanet,"Gas bubbling up from a lava-covered surface on 55 Cancri e may feed an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide. These days, detecting a planetary atmosphere tens or even hundreds of light-years from Earth might not sound like such a big deal. Scientists have found signs of atmosphere surrounding dozens of exoplanets over the past two decades. The catch is, all those planets have thick, hydrogen-dominated atmospheres that are relatively easy to study. The much thinner blankets of gas that almost certainly surround some small, rocky exoplanets have remained elusive. Researchers think they may have finally caught a glimpse of a volatile-rich atmosphere surrounding a rocky planet. Light emitted by the hot, highly-irradiated exoplanet 55 Cancri e shows compelling evidence for an atmosphere, probably rich in carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide, which may be bubbling from a vast ocean of lava covering the planet’s surface. The result is the best evidence to date for a rocky planet atmosphere outside our solar system."
NASA's Webb Cracks Case of Inflated Exoplanet,"A surprising deficiency of methane suggests that tidal heating has puffed up the atmosphere of the warm gas giant WASP-107 b. Why is the warm gas-giant exoplanet WASP-107 b so, so puffy? With a moderate temperature and an ultra-low density on par with a microwaved marshmallow, it seems to defy standard theories of planet formation and evolution. Two independent teams of researchers think they’ve figured it out. Data from Webb, combined with prior observations from Hubble, show that the interior of WASP-107 b must be a lot toastier than previously estimated. The unexpectedly high temperature, which is thought to be caused by tidal forces that stretch the planet like silly putty, can explain how planets like WASP-107 b can be so floofy, possibly solving a long-standing mystery in exoplanet science."
Galaxies Actively Forming in Early Universe Caught Feeding on Cold Gas,"Only Webb can detect and investigate these galaxies, which were forming within dense, opaque gas when the universe was only a few hundred million years old. A team in Denmark examining archival data from the James Webb Space Telescope recently found a trio of distant galaxies that are in the process of gathering gas when the universe was only a few hundred million years old. Their detection and characterization are remarkable achievements that only Webb is currently capable of, thanks to its specialization in infrared light. The data show for the first time that large reservoirs of gas surround these early galaxies. That gas will eventually fall into the galaxies, fueling new star formation, and, over millions of years, lead to highly structured galaxies brimming with stars."
Webb Finds Plethora of Carbon Molecules Around Young Star,"Result provides new insights into the ingredients for planet formation around very low-mass stars. Planets form in disks of gas and dust orbiting young stars. Observations indicate that rocky planets are more likely than gas giants to form around stars much more lightweight than our Sun. However, depending on conditions within the disk, the planets that form there could be very different from Earth. In a new study, astronomers used NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to study a red dwarf star weighing just one-tenth as much as our Sun. No known planets have formed around this young star yet, which is just one to two million years old. The team found that the gas in the planet-forming region of the star is rich in carbon-bearing molecules. Paradoxically, this means that any rocky planets that form there could be carbon-poor."
NASA's Webb Opens New Window on Supernova Science,"Webb finds 10 times more supernovae in the early universe than known before. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope is proving to be a fine supernova hunter! With its extreme infrared sensitivity, Webb is finding far-off supernovae almost everywhere it looks. Webb is ideal for identifying extremely distant supernovae because of a phenomenon called cosmological redshift, in which light traveling across the universe is stretched into longer wavelengths. Visible light from ancient supernovae is stretched so much that it ends up in the infrared. Webb’s instruments are tuned to see infrared light, making it ideal for finding these distant supernovae. Using data from a deep Webb survey of the early universe, a team has identified 10 times more far-off supernovae than were previously known. This study is the first significant step toward more extensive surveys of ancient supernovae with Webb."
Investigating the Origins of the Crab Nebula With NASA's Webb,"New data revises our view of this unusual supernova explosion. The Crab Nebula is a nearby example of the debris left behind when a star undergoes a violent death in a supernova explosion. However, despite decades of study, this supernova remnant continues to maintain a degree of mystery: What type of star was responsible for the creation of the Crab Nebula, and what was the nature of the explosion? NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has provided a new view of the Crab, including the highest-quality infrared data yet available to aid scientists as they explore the detailed structure and chemical composition of the remnant. These clues are helping to unravel the unusual way that the star exploded about 1,000 years ago."
First-of-Its-Kind Detection Made in Striking New Webb Image,"Alignment of bipolar jets confirms star formation theories Some of the greatest, and most interesting, astronomical discoveries have come as a surprise to researchers, even when examining the most well-studied areas of the sky. Often, it’s new technology or chance timing that result in these discoveries. In a new study of the Serpens Nebula with NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, it’s both. In one region of the nebula, Webb has resolved what previously appeared as blurry blobs into crisp protostellar outflows. And much to researchers’ surprise, those outflows are seen to be aligned, suggesting that we’ve caught this region at a unique moment in its history and providing information into the fundamentals of how stars are born."
Pillars of Creation Star in New Visualization from NASA's Hubble and Webb Telescopes,"The new visualization enables viewers to explore fundamental questions in science, experience how science is done, and discover the universe for themselves. Combining data from NASA's Hubble and James Webb space telescopes, a team from NASA's Universe of Learning at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland has produced a breathtaking new 3D visualization of the towering ""Pillars of Creation"" in the Eagle Nebula. This is the most comprehensive, detailed, multiwavelength movie yet of these iconic star-birthing clouds."
NASA's Webb Captures Celestial Fireworks Around Forming Star,"The colors within this mid-infrared image reveal details about the central protostar’s behavior NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope is celebrating U.S. Independence Day with an observation of the protostar, hidden inside the dark molecular cloud L1527 in mid-infrared light, as it evolves. This vibrant new view highlights the behavior of this young object and traces the different concentrations of gas and dust surrounding the protostar."
Vivid Portrait of Interacting Galaxies Marks Webb's Second Anniversary,"NASA's James Webb Space Telescope shows off a pair of intertwined galaxies in infrared light, its latest release in an ongoing run of observations. The James Webb Space Telescope operates around the clock, frequently astonishing researchers with its highly detailed — and incredibly precise — infrared images and data. These wavelengths of light, which lie beyond what our eyes can see, were largely out of reach at this level of detail until Webb began taking science observations July 12, 2022 on behalf of astronomers worldwide. To honor its second anniversary of science, the telescope observed Arp 142, an interacting galaxy pair nicknamed the Penguin and the Egg. The main image combines near- and mid-infrared light, which visually underscores how the galaxies are interacting — look for the faint upside-down blue U shape that envelops both galaxies — along with a “star party,” an abundance of recent star formation, in the Penguin."
"NASA's Webb Investigates Eternal Sunrises, Sunsets on Distant World","Near-infrared spectral analysis of terminator confirms differences in morning and evening atmosphere Since the first exoplanet was discovered in 1992, thousands of planets orbiting stars outside of our solar system have been confirmed through a myriad of different methods, including direct imaging, gravitational microlensing, measuring transits, and astrometry. Over the years, techniques have evolved to study these exoplanets, with astronomers learning details about the atmospheric compositions of these far-off worlds. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope is continuing to advance this field of study and deepen our understanding about the diversity of exoplanets and their atmospheres. The latest? Webb has allowed astronomers to parse out the atmospheric differences between the morning and evening on a tidally locked exoplanet — an incredible achievement for a distant world 700 light-years away from Earth like WASP-39 b."
NASA's Webb Images Cold Exoplanet 12 Light-Years Away,"Epsilon Indi Ab is colder than any other imaged planet beyond our solar system. If alien astronomers in a nearby star system had a telescope like NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, and they pointed it toward our solar system, then Jupiter might look very much like this new Webb image of the exoplanet Epsilon Indi Ab. It is one of the coldest exoplanets to be directly detected, with an estimated temperature of 35 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius). Epsilon Indi Ab is only around 180 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius) warmer than gas giants in our solar system. With so many known exoplanets looking nothing like the planets in our solar system, Epsilon Indi Ab provides a rare opportunity for astronomers to study the atmospheric composition of true solar system analogs."
Webb Finds Early Galaxies Weren't Too Big for Their Britches After All,"It got called the crisis in cosmology. But now astronomers can explain some surprising recent discoveries. Not long after the James Webb Space Telescope began science operations in July 2022, breathless headlines proclaimed that observations of distant galaxies were “breaking theories of cosmic evolution.” Astronomers had found galaxies that appeared much brighter than expected. If all of that light came from stars, then those galaxies would have formed so many stars, so quickly, that the leading theory for the universe’s formation and evolution could not explain them. New research finds that some of those early galaxies are in fact much less massive than they first appeared. Much of their light came, not from stars, but from a hot accretion disk surrounding a supermassive black hole."
NASA's Webb Reveals Distorted Galaxy Forming Cosmic Question Mark,"Astronomers are astounded by a rare cosmic alignment showcasing highly magnified star-forming regions in distant galaxies. What, why, how? The cosmos is full of questions. Still, astronomers using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope were surprised to find a distant, red galaxy distorted into the shape of a question mark. A specific, rarely-seen type of natural gravitational lens is causing the galaxy to appear multiple times. The lensing also magnifies the galaxy and its spiral companion, allowing astronomers to pinpoint specific regions of star formation, using a combination of infrared data from Webb and ultraviolet data from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope."
NASA's Webb Peers into the Extreme Outer Galaxy,"Among the Milky Way’s outskirts is a firecracker show of star formation. How do environmental factors affect the star formation process? To help answer this question, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope examined the fringes of our Milky Way galaxy. Webb’s near- and mid-infrared imaging capabilities enabled scientists to examine a star-forming area reminiscent of our galaxy during its early formation."
NASA's Webb Provides Another Look Into Galactic Collisions,"New infrared image highlights star formation triggered by merger-in-progress Arp 107, a pair of interacting galaxies, shines brightly in high-resolution infrared light. A collision, which occurred hundreds of millions ago, created a tenuous bridge of gas and dust that connects the two galaxies, and started a new wave of star formation that NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope captures clearly."
"In Odd Galaxy, NASA's Webb Finds Potential Missing Link to First Stars","With its gas shining brighter than its stars, a strange galaxy found one billion years after the big bang may represent a previously-unknown phase of galactic evolution. Amid a crowded field of galaxies captured by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, one otherwise inconspicuous galaxy stands out for emitting a light signature that astronomers have never seen before. Together, an observational astronomer and a theorist investigated potential causes. They concluded that the strange spectrum of galaxy GS-NDG-9422 is likely coming from its super-heated gas, not its stars. This intriguing conclusion opens up several future paths for investigation, including the connection between this odd galaxy and the universe’s first generation of stars – also predicted to be outshone by nebular gas."
NASA's Webb Reveals Unusual Jets of Volatile Gas from Icy Centaur 29P,"Scientists revealed unexpected outgassing from this object galloping across the outer solar system. Similar to the Ancient Greek mythological creature of the same name, centaurs in astronomy are in an in-between dynamical phase: leaving their distant and stable orbits beyond Neptune and migrating to the inner solar system, while also entering an active cometary phase. Being stored for billions of years in the freezing confines of the outer solar system, they preserve key insights about the birth of our solar system, which are uniquely revealed as they slowly start to unfreeze in this transient stage. Using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, a team of astronomers observed Centaur 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1, one of the most active and intriguing objects in the outer solar system. The high degree of detail captured by the telescope led to the discovery of new, previously unknown jets of gas, which is helping inform theories about how centaurs and planets are formed."
"'Blood-Soaked' Eyes: NASA's Webb, Hubble Examine Galaxy Pair","By teaming up, these two space telescopes have delivered the highest resolution image of IC 2163 and NGC 2207 to date in a combination of mid-infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. This ghastly galactic ""countenance"" recalls mythological human-hunters like the Algonquian wendigo — an emaciated figure with ashen flesh and glowing eyes that grows larger and larger as it feasts, and is never satiated. But this image, captured by the James Webb and Hubble space telescopes, isn’t a case of galactic cannibalism — at least, not yet. The smaller galaxy to the left, IC 2163, has ""slithered"" behind the larger one at right, NGC 2207, millions of years ago. Though we can’t wait around for millions of years to see what may happen next, researchers can use this crisp combination of mid-infrared light from Webb, and ultraviolet and visible light from Hubble to learn more about the pair, and improve models that may preview the galaxies’ upcoming ""thrills."""
"NASA's Hubble, Webb Probe Surprisingly Smooth Disk Around Vega","Legendary Star Lacks Evidence for Large Planet Construction Ever since the dawn of human consciousness, skywatchers have been mystified by ""wandering stars."" These are the five visible planets circling our Sun. It was thought they influenced earthly affairs and allowed for future predictions through the pseudoscience of astrology. But real astronomers asked: where did the planets come from? In the late 18th century, Immanuel Kant and Pierre-Simon Laplace hypothesized that the planets condensed out of a disk of dust and gas encircling the newborn Sun. This was based on the observations that the planet's orbits are co-planar, and they all move in the same direction, like a spinning phonograph record. In essence, their orbits are the residual skeleton of the long-vanished disk. But astronomers had to wait 200 years before the first telescopic evidence was collected that supported Kant and Laplace's conjecture. With the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), they found a puzzling excess of infrared light from warm dust around the bright blue star Vega in the summer constellation Lyra. This was interpreted as a disk of planet-forming material. Observations with IRAS discovered that such disks are common around young stars. Vega was the first clue. Teams of astronomers have now used the combined power of the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes to revisit the legendary Vega disk. Hubble sees debris the size of smoke particles, and Webb traces roughly sand-grain-sized particles. The big surprise is that there is no obvious evidence for one or more large planets plowing through the disk like snow tractors. This is common around other young stars. However, the Vega disk looks almost as smooth as a pancake, with no signs of planets. Vega is forcing astronomers to rethink the range and variety among planetary systems around other stars. The disk architecture apparently plays out differently around other star systems. Hubble and Webb are showing us that the starry sky is all about unanticipated diversity when it comes to planetary construction yards."
Hats Off to NASA's Webb: Sombrero Galaxy Dazzles in New Image,"Powerful mid-infrared instrument resolves clumpy nature of dusty disk There’s somewhat of an inside joke in the astronomical community that researchers aren’t the best at naming things. For example, the first star observed by Webb is named HD 84406. Not so catchy. Neither is galaxy cluster MACS0416, a deep field imaged by Webb recently. There are exceptions to this, though. Think the Hourglass Nebula, the Cigar Galaxy, or the Cat’s Paw Nebula. All named for the objects on Earth that they resemble. The Sombrero Galaxy is aptly named for its likeness to the wide-brimmed hat. However, it appears the name is not always accurate, as NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope’s look shows. In the mid-infrared, the 'crown' of the 'hat' is no longer visible, causing the galaxy to take on a much different appearance."
Found: First Actively Forming Galaxy as Lightweight as Young Milky Way,"This galaxy, which is stretched and magnified, glitters with 10 distinct star clusters that formed at different times. Like fireflies “dancing” on a warm summer night, 10 distinct star clusters appear in observations from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. They are held in a cocoon of diffuse light emitted by other stars scattered around them. This galaxy, known as Firefly Sparkle, was taking shape around 600 million years after the big bang. Researchers using Webb’s images and data concluded that the Firefly Sparkle had the same mass as our Milky Way galaxy would have if we could “turn back time” to weigh it as it was assembling. How is this analysis possible? A natural effect known as gravitational lensing, which allows researchers to “zoom in” on extremely distant objects that perfectly align with Webb’s view. When combined with the telescope’s near-infrared images and data, astronomers can study distant objects in astonishing detail."
NASA's Webb Finds Planet-Forming Disks Lived Longer in Early Universe,"New data confirms Hubble finding and refutes current theories of planet formation in universe’s early days. Thanks to its extraordinary sensitivity and resolution, Webb just solved a mystery more than two decades old. In 2003, the Hubble Space Telescope saw evidence of a massive planet around an ancient star. This puzzled astronomers, who knew that such stars in the early universe lacked a lot of the heavier elements considered essential for building planets. Current models predict that the disks around this type of star have short lifetimes, so short that planets cannot grow large, or maybe even form at all. Yet, there it was! Astronomers then turned to a nearby proxy for the early universe – the star-forming region NGC 346. There, Hubble saw signs that planet-forming disks existed around stars 20 to 30 million years old, much older than theories predicted such disks could survive. The Hubble findings were intriguing, but without a way to obtain spectra, scientists could not be sure they were witnessing genuine accretion and the presence of disks. Now, using Webb, researchers have confirmed the presence of planet-forming disks in NGC 346, and discovered that these disks are long-lived. The finding affirms the Hubble result, and it is causing scientists to rethink current models of planet formation."
"Webb Watches Carbon-Rich Dust Shells Form, Expand in Star System","The telescope shows that the winds of two massive stars are producing carbon-rich dust, which may eventually “seed” new stars and planets. How are the elements like carbon produced and spread across space? Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have identified two stars responsible for generating carbon-rich dust a mere 5,000 light-years away in our own Milky Way galaxy. As the massive stars in Wolf-Rayet 140 swing past one another on their elongated orbits, their winds collide and produce carbon-rich dust. For a few months every eight years, the stars form a new shell of dust that expands outward — and may eventually go on to become part of stars that form elsewhere in our galaxy. Webb’s mid-infrared light observations show 17 irregular shells around these stars — but many more may have dissipated and thousands more will be created. These findings offer definitive clues about carbon’s beginnings that may help the astronomy community unwind how elements go on to form new stars and planets."
"Newfound Galaxy Class May Indicate Early Black Hole Growth, Webb Finds","Scientists compile large sample of an unusual class of objects in an effort to connect the dots to the early universe. Soon after the start of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope’s science operations, astronomers noticed something unexpected in the data: red objects that appear small on the sky, located in the distant, young universe. Come to be known as “little red dots” (LRDs), this intriguing class of objects is not well understood at present, sparking new questions and prompting new theories about the processes that occurred in the early universe. By combing through publicly available Webb datasets, a team of astronomers has recently assembled one of the largest samples of LRDs to date, nearly all of which existed during the first 1.5 billion years after the big bang. They concluded that a large fraction of the LRDs in their sample likely are galaxies with growing black holes at their centers."
"NASA's Webb Reveals Intricate Layers of Interstellar Dust, Gas","A supernova flashbulb illuminated otherwise unseen material between the stars. The space between the stars is filled with gas and dust – sometimes thick, sometimes thin, and often invisible unless illuminated. A cosmic spotlight in the form of a supernova flash has lit up interstellar material in the constellation of Cassiopeia. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope is showing astronomers new details including knots, sheets, and clouds that are likely sculpted by magnetic fields."
Webb Maps Full Picture of How Phoenix Galaxy Cluster Forms Stars,"Discovery proves decades-old theory of galaxy feeding cycle. Since its discovery in 2010, the Phoenix cluster has always been one to stand out from the bunch. It's one of the most massive galaxy clusters known to astronomers, and was the first galaxy cluster found to have a supermassive black hole that promotes, instead of hinders, a high rate of star formation. Just how that was happening, though, remained a mystery. Researchers could see super-hot gas, and super-cold filaments of gas hiding forming stars. However, the in-between remained unseen. That is, until NASA's James Webb Space Telescope's infrared eye examined the cluster's core and found the missing cooling gas."
Webb Reveals Rapid-Fire Light Show From Milky Way's Central Black Hole,"Observations revealed ongoing fireworks featuring short bursts and longer flares. Imagine solar flares, but on a mind-boggling scale. A constant scintillation that is bright enough to shine across 26,000 light-years of space. And interspersed between the flickers, brilliant flashes that spew out on a daily basis. Researchers using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope have spotted this activity in the center of our galaxy. The source is the accretion disk around the Milky Way’s central supermassive black hole. Webb detected brightness changes over remarkably short timescales, meaning they are coming from the black hole’s inner disk, not far beyond its event horizon."
NASA's Webb Exposes Complex Atmosphere of Starless Super-Jupiter,"Webb has captured evidence for patchy cloud layers, high-altitude hot spots, and variations in chemistry around a rapidly rotating, free-floating object 20 light-years from Earth. Getting a nice, good look at a planet outside our solar system can be tricky. Some exoplanets are way too cool and dim to observe. Many are virtually invisible in the blinding glare of their host stars. Others spin so slowly it would take days to survey the entire planet. This is where a stand-in like SIMP 0136 — a hot, bright, planet-sized object with a thick atmosphere, extremely fast rotation rate, and no star to spoil the view — comes in handy. Although SIMP 0136 is not technically an exoplanet because it doesn’t orbit a star, it’s close enough. Using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to monitor SIMP 0136 directly as different parts of the object rotate into view, researchers have been able to disentangle the brightness patterns of hundreds of colors of infrared light coming from different parts of the object’s atmosphere. The results reveal variations in cloud cover, temperature, and chemistry that provide insight into the three-dimensional complexity of gas giants within and beyond our solar system."
NASA Webb Wows With Incredible Detail in Actively Forming Star System,"This near-infrared image shows the history of ejections from the two actively forming stars in Lynds 483. This scene is still transforming. What look like twin flames are known as Lynds 483 (L483), ejections from two actively forming stars at the center. The stars themselves are hidden in a teeny, opaque disk of dust that fits into one pixel. This is the most detailed image of L483 to date, delivered in high-resolution near-infrared light by the James Webb Space Telescope. For tens of thousands of years, the two central stars have been sending out column-like jets along with more “relaxed” outflows that willow, spread, and drape. As the ejections run into one another, new molecules form within the lobes. After roughly 1 million years have passed, the stars’ outbursts will end, with the stars fully formed. The iridescent regions of gas and dust will fade, and the scene will significantly clear."
NASA's Webb Peers Deeper into Mysterious Flame Nebula,"New population census answers the question: How small can you go when forming stars and brown dwarfs? The Flame Nebula, a star-forming region in the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex, has a long history of observation from telescopes such as NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. However, the smallest stars within its dark and dusty heart have largely been hidden from view. The infrared vision from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has taken a first-time look, counting the smallest and faintest objects to determine the lowest mass required to form brown dwarfs."
"NASA's Webb Images Young, Giant Exoplanets, Detects Carbon Dioxide","Findings suggest giant exoplanets in HR 8799 system likely formed like Jupiter and Saturn. The first planet outside our solar system was discovered in the 1990’s, but it wasn’t until more than a decade later astronomers actually obtained a direct image of one. It’s extremely difficult to image an exoplanet, as stars in other planetary systems can be thousands of times brighter and bigger than their planets. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope is equipped with a highly sensitive coronagraph, a tiny mask that blocks the light of the star, allowing Webb to image exoplanets. Webb’s new images of two iconic systems, HR 8799 and 51 Eridani, and their planets have stunned researchers, and provided additional information into the chemical make-up of the young gas giants."
NASA's Webb Telescope Unmasks True Nature of the Cosmic Tornado,"Webb’s exquisite details reveal a chance, random alignment of a protostellar outflow and a distant spiral galaxy. When peering out into space, we get a 2D view of a 3D universe. Sometimes, images will capture objects that appear close to each other on the sky, but are actually at wildly different distances and are unassociated with each other. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope captured this beautiful juxtaposition of the nearby protostellar outflow known as Herbig-Haro 49/50 with a perfectly positioned, more distant spiral galaxy. Due to the close proximity of this Herbig-Haro object to the Earth, this new composite infrared image of the outflow from a young star allows researchers to examine details on small spatial scales like never before. With Webb, we can better understand how the jet activity associated with the formation of young stars can affect their surrounding environment."
NASA's Webb Captures Neptune's Auroras For First Time,"Long-sought auroral glow finally emerges under Webb’s powerful gaze. Neptune lies in the frigid, dark, vast frontier of the outer edges of our solar system about 3 billion miles away from the Sun. It’s only been visited once by a spacecraft back in 1989, and since then, observatories like NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope have tracked the planet’s changing weather. Hubble even discovered a new moon orbiting the planet in 2013. In many images, the planet appears as a blueish orb, sometimes with disappearing and reappearing dark spots. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has now revealed a different appearance—for the first time, a bright auroral glow from this ice giant."
NASA's Webb Sees Galaxy Mysteriously Clearing Fog of Early Universe,"Unexpected, bright hydrogen emission caught astronomers by surprise. The early universe was filled with a thick fog of neutral hydrogen. Even though the first stars and galaxies emitted copious amounts of ultraviolet light, that light struggled to pierce the fog. It took hundreds of millions of years for the neutral hydrogen to become ionized, electrons stripped from protons, allowing light to travel freely through space. Astronomers are seeking to understand this unique time of transformation, known as the era of reionization. A newly discovered galaxy illuminated this era in an unexpected way. JADES-GS-z13-1, observed just 330 million years after the big bang, shows bright hydrogen emission that should have been absorbed by the cosmic fog. Theorists are struggling to explain how its light could have pierced the fog at such an early time."
NASA Webb Explores Effect of Strong Magnetic Fields on Star Formation,"Two new research studies explore how a stellar nursery in the heart of the Milky Way is affected by the region’s strong magnetic fields. Despite decades of study, the process of star formation still holds many mysteries. Stars are the source of nearly all the universe’s chemical elements, including carbon and oxygen, so understanding why and how they form — or not — is a crucial initial step in understanding how the universe works and the origins of just about everything, including life on Earth. At the heart of our Milky Way galaxy is the star-forming region Sagittarius C, which despite a wealth of raw material does not make as many stars as astronomers would expect. Two new studies have used NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to investigate star formation in this extreme environment that is relatively near the supermassive black hole at the core of the Milky Way, at 200 light-years distance."
NASA Webb's Autopsy of Planet Swallowed by Star Yields Surprise,"Lingering brightness provides evidence for how planet met its demise. Every year, scientists around the world apply for observing time on NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. When proposals are selected after a vigorous vetting, the programs go into Webb’s observation queue for the future, ready to be scheduled based on various factors, including windows of visibility. However, what if an astronomer wants to study something, but they don’t know ahead of time exactly when that event will take place? Or where? Think supernova explosions or a gamma ray burst. This is called a Target of Opportunity (ToO) observation, which astronomers can define in the proposal planning phase, ready to have them ‘enacted’ when the time comes. One of the first ToO programs performed by Webb has now proven fruitful, providing insights into the immediate aftermath of when a star swallowed its own planet."
"With NASA's Webb, Dying Star's Energetic Display Comes Into Full Focus","Only the James Webb Space Telescope has the ability to fully detail this planetary nebula’s dusty rings with its unique mid-infrared camera. Come one, come all to witness the “magic” of a dying star’s dust sent across space! The James Webb Space Telescope has taken the most detailed image of planetary nebula NGC 1514 to date thanks to its unique mid-infrared observations. Webb’s image brings out the nebula’s nuances, particularly its “fuzzy” dusty rings. Also look for holes in the central pink region where material has broken through. Two central stars, which appear as one in Webb’s image, formed this scene over thousands of years — and will keep at it for thousands more."
NASA's Webb Lifts Veil on Common but Mysterious Type of Exoplanet,"Scientists determine atmospheric makeup of small, hot, gassy sub-Neptune. Much smaller than gas-giants and typically cooler than hot Jupiters, sub-Neptunes were extremely challenging to observe before the launch of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. Though they appear to be the most common type of exoplanet in our galaxy, you won’t find them in our solar system. Astronomers are trying to understand how these planets formed and evolved, why they are so common, and why they don’t orbit our Sun. Adding to the mystery, many sub-Neptunes appear to be very highly obscured by clouds and hazes, which have made it impossible to determine their atmospheric makeup. Now, by using Webb to study the hot sub-Neptune TOI-421 b, scientists have uncovered the chemical fingerprints of its atmosphere. Did this exoplanet form and evolve differently from the cooler, sub-Neptunes observed previously? Do TOI-421 b’s differences indicate a new classification of hot sub-Neptunes, or is it just that exoplanets are very diverse? By using Webb, researchers hope to find out."
New Visualization From NASA's Webb Telescope Explores Cosmic Cliffs,"Iconic Webb image transforms into a 3D landscape of gas, dust, and stars. Powerful observatories like the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes have captured hundreds of vivid images of the cosmos. Yet even the most stunning images are a 2D representation of a 3D universe. It becomes difficult to get a sense of the true scale and structure of what we’re seeing. By combining real data with scientific expertise and a dash of artistic license, a visualization team from NASA’s Universe of Learning has transformed one of Webb’s first images, the Cosmic Cliffs, into a 3D panorama.

"NASA's Webb Reveals New Details, Mysteries in Jupiter's Aurora","Webb sees the aurora flickering, fluctuating, and undulating at Jupiter’s north pole. Earth’s auroras, also known as the Northern and Southern Lights, appear as shimmering curtains visible to observers on the ground and even astronauts aboard the International Space Station. Auroras occur when energetic particles from the Sun are funneled by our magnetic field and slam into the atmosphere near Earth’s poles. The planet Jupiter experiences auroras on a much grander scale – both larger and hundreds of times brighter than Earth’s. Astronomers turned Webb’s keen gaze to Jupiter and found that its auroras “pop” and “fizz,” changing on timescales of minutes or even seconds."
Webb's Titan Forecast: Partly Cloudy With Occasional Methane Showers,"Astronomers see evidence of clouds bubbling up over Titan’s northern hemisphere. Saturn’s moon Titan is the only solar system moon with a substantial atmosphere. It also contains a soup of carbon-containing molecules, making it an intriguing target for astrobiological studies despite its frigid temperature of about -290 degrees Fahrenheit (-180 degrees Celsius). Astronomers have used both probes like Cassini/Huygens and ground-based telescopes like the W.M. Keck Observatories to monitor weather on Titan. Now, a team has combined data from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope and the Keck II telescope to see evidence of cloud convection in Titan’s northern hemisphere for the first time. Most of Titan’s lakes and seas are located in that hemisphere, and are likely replenished by an occasional rain of methane and ethane."
Another First: NASA Webb Identifies Frozen Water in Young Star System,"Researchers found water ice throughout a dusty debris disk circling the Sun-like star HD 181327. We know water in its solid state — ice — exists on moons orbiting Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Telescopes have also spotted frozen water on dwarf planets, comets, and other bits of rock that “hang out” in the Kuiper Belt at the edge of our solar system. But for decades, water ice was not confirmed to exist around other stars. The James Webb Space Telescope has unequivocally changed that: Data from its NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) confirmed the presence of water ice in a dusty debris disk that surrounds a star known as HD 181327. Water ice heavily influences the formation of giant planets and may also be delivered by comets to fully formed rocky planets. Now that researchers have detected water ice with Webb, they have opened the door to studying how these processes play out in new ways — in many other planetary systems — for all researchers."
NASA's Webb Rounds Out Picture of Sombrero Galaxy’s Disk,"Stellar light shines from iconic target in near-infrared The Sombrero galaxy has long had a place in astronomical history as an intriguing object. The first written record of this galaxy was noted in 1781, almost 250 years ago, by Pierre Méchain, a French astronomer and surveyor. Méchain was a longtime collaborator of Charles Messier, of the Messier catalog fame. While the Sombrero galaxy didn’t earn an official place in the Messier catalog until 1921 (as Messier 104), since it’s easily visible from the Northern Hemisphere with a backyard telescope or even binoculars, it remained top of mind for observers over the years. Now, new observations from the world’s premiere space observatory have added to the history of this storied galaxy."
Frigid Exoplanet in Strange Orbit Imaged by NASA's Webb,"First image ever taken of exoplanet in extremely mis-aligned system NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has not only become known for groundbreaking science discoveries across all fields of astrophysics, but also for its gorgeous, intricate images of celestial objects like star-forming regions and solar system planets. Webb’s images of exoplanets look noticeably different than those sweeping landscapes, though. This is because it is extremely difficult to image planets orbiting stars other than our own Sun. Oftentimes the host stars are thousands of times brighter than the planets that orbit them, and the planets are relatively close to their stars on the sky. However, researchers can obtain an abundance of information from what appears as just a distant dot in an image. Webb’s new image of 14 Herculis c, a cold exoplanet orbiting a star 60 light-years away from Earth, has given researchers insight into the planet’s temperature, strange orbit, and atmospheric dynamics."
Likely Saturn-Mass Planet Imaged by NASA Webb Is Lightest Ever Seen,"The newfound planet represents Webb’s first direct image discovery of a planet. Almost 6,000 exoplanets have been discovered to date. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has just added another likely planet to that list: a Saturn-mass planet named TWA 7 b. Astronomers found it by blocking the light of its host star to reveal the hidden planet. It’s located in a gap in one of three dust rings that were discovered around the star TWA 7 by previous ground-based observations. The object’s brightness, color, distance from the star, and position within the ring are consistent with theoretical predictions for a planet that is expected to be sculpting the surrounding debris disk."
NASA's Webb Digs into Structural Origins of Disk Galaxies,"Scientists “excavated” disk galaxies across cosmic time to understand their formation history. Disk galaxies, like our own Milky Way galaxy, commonly consist of both a thick and thin disk of stars — each with different features, including stellar population and movement. Three major theoretical scenarios have been proposed to explain the formation mechanisms and timing of thick and thin disks. A team of astronomers has recently investigated the structure of disk galaxies by sifting through multiple surveys from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. This extensive sample includes over 100 edge-on disk galaxies up to roughly 11 billion years ago. The team’s analysis aligns with one of the three scenarios, suggesting that thick stellar disk formation occurs first, and thin stellar disk formation follows. When this happens in a galaxy’s formation history depends on the galaxy’s mass."
"NASA Webb 'Pierces' Bullet Cluster, Refines Its Mass","Webb shows fainter and more distant galaxies, along with light from stars that trace dark matter in these galaxy clusters, helping researchers carefully map everything in the scene. It’s rare for galaxy clusters to collide and merge at high speeds. An iconic example is the Bullet Cluster, the aftermath of two vast galaxy clusters that collided. To be able to “replay” what happened, and in which order, researchers need to first fully define all the contents in this scene. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has provided some of the best information to date: Highly precise, extremely detailed near-infrared images of a significant portion of the Bullet Cluster. Its new observations allowed researchers to fine tune their maps of its mass, including an invisible substance known as dark matter that does not emit, reflect, or absorb light."
