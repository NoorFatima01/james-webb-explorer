NASA's Webb Measures the Temperature of a Rocky Exoplanet,"The amount of infrared light coming from TRAPPIST-1 b suggests that the planet is devoid of any significant atmosphere. Acting as a giant touch-free thermometer, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has successfully measured heat radiating from the innermost of the seven rocky planets orbiting TRAPPIST-1, a cool red dwarf star 40 light-years from Earth. With a dayside temperature of 450 degrees Fahrenheit, the planet is just about perfect for baking pizza. But with no atmosphere to speak of, it may not be the best spot to dine out. The result is the first from a comprehensive set of Webb studies of the TRAPPIST-1 system, and marks an important step in determining whether planets orbiting tiny but violent red dwarfs, the most common type of star in the Galaxy, can sustain atmospheres needed to support life."
NASA’s Webb Scores Another Ringed World with New Image of Uranus,"Webb's infrared image highlights the planet's dramatic rings and dynamic atmosphere. The planet Uranus is an oddball in our solar system, tilted on its side as it orbits the sun, causing extreme seasons. While the planet’s atmosphere appeared nearly featureless when visited by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986, subsequent observations from the ground and in space have shown turbulent storms."
Webb Reveals Never-Before-Seen Details in Cassiopeia A,"Glowing dust and elements display complex structures that are challenging for scientists to explain. The explosion of a star is a dramatic event, but the remains that the star leaves behind can be even more dramatic. A new mid-infrared image from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope provides one stunning example. It shows the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A), created by a stellar explosion 340 years ago from Earth's perspective. The image displays vivid colors and intricate structures begging to be examined more closely. Cas A is the youngest known remnant from an exploding, massive star in our galaxy, offering astronomers an opportunity to perform stellar forensics to understand the star’s death."
Webb Captures the Spectacular Galactic Merger Arp 220,"A Dazzling Display of Star Birth Captured in Infrared A stunning smash-up of two spiral galaxies shines in infrared with the light of more than a trillion suns. Collectively called Arp 220, the colliding galaxies ignited a tremendous burst of star birth. Each of the combining galactic cores is encircled by a rotating, star-forming ring blasting out the glaring light that Webb captured in infrared. This brilliant light creates a prominent, spiked, starburst feature."
Webb Reveals Early-Universe Prequel to Huge Galaxy Cluster,"Protocluster Confirmed, 650 Million Years after the Big Bang How did we get here? This fundamental question may be applied on its grandest scale in cosmology, which investigates the history and origin of the universe. Astronomers are able to investigate the early universe and its development like never before with NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, including the first galaxies."
"Webb Finds Water Vapor, But From a Rocky Planet or Its Star?","More observations will be needed to determine if exoplanet GJ 486 b has an atmosphere. GJ 486 b is about 30% larger than the Earth and three times as massive, which means it is a rocky world with stronger gravity than Earth. It orbits a red dwarf star in just under 1.5 Earth days. It is too close to its star to be within the habitable zone, with a surface temperature of about 800 degrees Fahrenheit. And yet, Webb observations show hints of water vapor."
Webb Looks for Fomalhaut's Asteroid Belt and Finds Much More,"Nearby Planetary System Seen in Breathtaking Detail A new Webb Space Telescope image of the bright, nearby star Fomalhaut reveals its planetary system with details never seen before, including nested concentric rings of dust. These belts most likely are carved by the gravitational forces produced by embedded, unseen planets. Similarly, inside our solar system Jupiter corrals the asteroid belt of leftover debris that lies between us and the giant planet. Astronomers first discovered Fomalhaut’s disk in 1983. But there has never been a view as spectacular – or as revealing – as Webb’s."
"NASA's Webb Finds Water, and a New Mystery, in Rare Main Belt Comet","The James Webb Space Telescope’s latest discovery is a tale of two detections. Solar system scientists took NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope on a treasure hunt in the asteroid belt, and what they didn’t find turned out to be as significant as what they did. If a spectrum of possible chemical compounds serves as a map of what to look for, X marked the spot of water vapor on Comet Read – a long-sought clue in the larger mystery of how Earth’s liquid water, and consequently life, first came to be. However, carbon dioxide was missing from the map, though it is present in all other comets. So in addition to continuing to pursue the history of ancient water in the solar system, scientists have an unexpected new quest on their hands, and will be hunting for answers in our cosmic backyard."
Webb Maps Surprisingly Large Plume Jetting From Saturn’s Moon Enceladus,"Interaction between moon’s plumes and Saturn’s ring system explored with Webb. Enceladus—a tiny, icy moon of Saturn—is one of the most intriguing objects in the search for signs of life beyond our own planet."
"Early Universe Crackled With Bursts of Star Formation, Webb Shows","Webb also continues to uncover a bounty of distant, young galaxies With its large, light-gathering mirror and infrared sensitivity, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is uniquely suited to study galaxies that existed in the early universe, just a few hundred million years after the big bang. Just over one whole month of Webb’s observing time is devoted to the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, or JADES. JADES will peer deeply into the universe to study some of the faintest and most distant galaxies. Among the program’s first findings: Hundreds of galaxies that existed when the universe was less than 600 million years old, and galaxies that have undergone repeated bursts of star formation."
NASA's Webb Proves Galaxies Transformed the Early Universe,"Early galaxies’ stars allowed light to travel freely by heating and ionizing intergalactic gas, clearing vast regions around them. Cave divers equipped with brilliant headlamps often explore cavities in rock less than a mile beneath our feet. It’s easy to be wholly unaware of these cave systems – even if you sit in a meadow above them – because the rock between you and the spelunkers prevents light from their headlamps from disturbing the idyllic afternoon."
Webb Rules Out Thick Carbon Dioxide Atmosphere for Rocky Exoplanet,"Infrared measurements of TRAPPIST-1 c indicate that it is probably not as Venus-like as once imagined. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has successfully measured the heat radiating from TRAPPIST-1 c, an exoplanet orbiting a red dwarf star 40 light-years from Earth. With a dayside temperature of about 225 degrees Fahrenheit, it is the coolest rocky planet ever characterized using this method."
Webb Makes First Detection of Crucial Carbon Molecule,"This molecule, never before seen in space, is believed to be a cornerstone of interstellar organic chemistry. Carbon compounds form the foundations of all known life, and as such are of a particular interest to scientists working to understand both how life developed on Earth, and how it could potentially develop elsewhere in our universe. As such, the study of interstellar organic (carbon-containing) chemistry is an area of keen fascination to many astronomers."
NASA's Webb Identifies the Earliest Strands of the Cosmic Web,"A filament of 10 galaxies seen just 830 million years after the birth of the universe Woven across our universe is a weblike structure of galaxies called the cosmic web. Galaxies are strung along filaments in this vast web, which also contains enormous voids. Now, astronomers using Webb have discovered an early strand of this structure, a long, narrow filament of 10 galaxies that existed just 830 million years after the big bang. The 3 million light-year-long structure is anchored by a luminous quasar – a galaxy with an active, supermassive black hole at its core. The team believes this early thread of the cosmic web will eventually evolve into a massive cluster of galaxies."
Webb Locates Dust Reservoirs in Two Supernovae,"The finding suggests supernovae are likely suppliers of dust to early, young galaxies. Supernovae, the explosive deaths of stars, are some of the universe’s biggest bursts of energy and light. When they erupt, one supernova can shine even brighter than an entire galaxy."
Webb Detects Most Distant Active Supermassive Black Hole to Date,"With Webb, a slew of other distant black holes and early galaxies also popped into view for the first time. It’s a bonanza! The universe is absolutely teeming with black holes. Researchers have long known this, but less massive black holes that existed in the early universe were too dim to detect – that is until the James Webb Space Telescope began taking observations. Researchers behind the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey are among the first to begin plucking these bright, extremely distant objects from Webb’s highly detailed images and data."
"New 3D Visualization Highlights 5,000 Galaxies Revealed by Webb in CEERS Survey","Data shows Webb’s ability to image and identify thousands of galaxies at once. The Space Telescope Science Institute’s Office of Public Outreach has released a new scientific visualization of data from the CEERS (Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science) Survey. The video represents Webb’s exploration of the region known as the Extended Groth Strip, revealing many galaxies that have never been seen before. It displays a wealth of galaxies across the universe and concludes on Maisie’s Galaxy, which resides 13.4 billion light-years away from Earth."
Webb Celebrates First Year of Science With Close-up on Birth of Sun-like Stars,"NASA's James Webb Space Telescope continues to wow with an action-packed image belying a relatively quiet star-forming region. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope caps a successful first year of science, and stunning imagery, with a detailed view of the closest star-forming region to Earth, the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex, resulting in a dynamic image that belies the region’s relative quiet – and practically begs for explanation of what exactly we are looking at. While dual jets have been seen blasting out of new stars before, the texture that Webb’s NIRCam instrument reveals in the multiple jets crisscrossing the image is unprecedented. In striking contrast, the lower half of the image is dominated by a glowing cave of dust being lit up and eroded by the most massive star in the scene. Its stellar neighbors are the mass of our Sun or smaller, with some displaying the telltale shadows of protoplanetary disks—meaning we are looking at planetary systems potentially similar to our own in their earliest stages."
Webb Detects Water Vapor in Rocky Planet-forming Zone,"The finding shows that a water reservoir is available for terrestrial planets that might be coalescing there. Water, water, everywhere – not in drops, but as steam. Scientists using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope have discovered that thirsty planets in the PDS 70 system have access to a reservoir of water. Importantly, the water vapor was found within 100 million miles of the star – the region where terrestrial planets like Earth may be forming. (The Earth orbits 93 million miles from our Sun.)"
Webb Snaps Highly Detailed Infrared Image of Actively Forming Stars,"Forecast: There’s a 100% chance of recurring two-sided jets for a pair of stars that are actively gathering mass. Like kittens, actively forming stars are balls of energy. But instead of being overtaken by the zoomies, stars emit energy in the form of jets, creating fantastic, textured scenes. That’s the case for two tightly orbiting stars, known as Herbig-Haro 46/47."
Webb Spotlights Gravitational Arcs in 'El Gordo' Galaxy Cluster,"New image reveals galaxy groups, smudges, and dusty distant objects. The Fishhook. The Thin One. These are just two of the striking targets revealed in new detail by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. In July 2022 Webb observed El Gordo, a galaxy cluster that existed 6.2 billion years after the big bang. It was selected as the most massive galaxy cluster known at that time in cosmic history."
"Webb Reveals Colors of Earendel, Most Distant Star Ever Detected","Observations hint at companion star Detecting extremely distant stars, or those closest in time to the big bang, can provide insights into the first few chapters of the history of our universe. In 2022, the Hubble Space Telescope broke its own record, and spotted the most distant star yet. This star, nicknamed Earendel, emitted its light within the universe’s first billion years."
Webb Reveals New Structures Within Iconic Supernova,"Small crescent-like structures come into clear view. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has uncovered new details in Supernova 1987A with its NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) instrument. Structures, some only visible in infrared wavelengths, provide clues into the development of supernovas over time."
"Webb Discovers Methane, Carbon Dioxide in Atmosphere of K2-18 b","Data hints at exoplanet possessing possible liquid ocean surface Carbon-bearing molecules have been discovered in the atmosphere of the habitable zone exoplanet K2-18 b by an international team of astronomers using data from the NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. These results are consistent with an exoplanet that may contain ocean-covered surface underneath a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. This discovery provides a fascinating glimpse into a planet unlike anything in our Solar System, and raises interesting prospects about potentially habitable worlds elsewhere in the Universe."
NASA's Webb Snaps Supersonic Outflow of Young Star,"Infrared capabilities map out molecular structure of outflow NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has captured a high-resolution look at Herbig-Haro 211 (HH 211), a bipolar jet traveling through interstellar space at supersonic speeds. At roughly 1,000 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Perseus, the object is one of the youngest and nearest protostellar outflows, making it an ideal target for Webb."
NASA’s Webb Finds Carbon Source on Surface of Jupiter’s Moon Europa,"Carbon suggests favorable environment for life in subsurface ocean For as long as humans have gazed into the night sky, we have wondered about life beyond the Earth. Scientists now know that several places in our solar system might have conditions suitable for life. One of these is Jupiter’s moon Europa, a fascinating world with a salty, subsurface ocean of liquid water—possibly twice as much as in all of Earth’s oceans combined. However, scientists had not confirmed if Europa’s ocean contained biologically essential chemicals, particularly carbon, the universal building block for life as we know it. Now, using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have found carbon on Europa’s surface, which likely originated in this ocean. The discovery signals a potentially habitable environment in the ocean of Europa."
NASA's Webb Captures an Ethereal View of NGC 346,"Filaments of dust and gas festoon this star-forming region in a new infrared image from MIRI Within a neighboring dwarf galaxy known as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) lies a dramatic region of star birth – NGC 346, shown here. As the brightest and largest star-forming region in the SMC, it has been studied intensely by a variety of telescopes. NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope showed a visible-light view filled with thousands of stars. More recently, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope offered a near-infrared vista highlighting both cool and warm dust. Now, Webb has turned its mid-infrared gaze to NGC 346, revealing streamers of gas and dust studded with bright patches filled with young protostars."
NASA's Webb Detects Tiny Quartz Crystals in Clouds of Hot Gas Giant,"Flakes of silica “snow” fill the skies of puffy, searing-hot exoplanet WASP-17 b. Catching a glimpse of one of the most common and familiar minerals on Earth rarely merits a headline. Quartz is found in beach sands, building stones, geodes, and gem shops around the world. It’s melted to produce glass, refined for silicon microchips, and used in watches to keep time."
NASA's Webb Discovers New Feature in Jupiter's Atmosphere,"Narrow jet stream near equator has winds traveling 320 miles per hour. Jupiter has some of the most conspicuous atmospheric features in our solar system. The planet’s Great Red Spot, large enough to envelop Earth, is nearly as well known as some of the various rivers and mountains on the planet we call home."
NASA's Webb Makes First Detection of Heavy Element from Star Merger,"Webb’s study of the second-brightest gamma-ray burst ever seen reveals tellurium. Under what conditions many chemical elements are created in the universe has long been shrouded in mystery. This includes elements that are highly valuable, or even vital to life as we know it."
The Crab Nebula Seen in New Light by NASA's Webb,"Exquisite, never-before-seen details help unravel the supernova remnant’s puzzling history. Although the Crab Nebula is one of the most well-studied supernova remnants, questions about its progenitor and the nature of the explosion that created it still remain unanswered. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope is on the case as it sleuths for any clues that remain within the supernova remnant. Webb’s infrared sensitivity and spatial resolution are offering astronomers a more comprehensive understanding of the still-expanding scene."
NASA's Webb Findings Support Long-Proposed Process of Planet Formation,"Drifting pebbles deliver water to the inner regions of planet-forming disks How are planets born? Scientists have long proposed that ice-covered pebbles are the seeds of planet formation. These icy solids are thought to drift toward the newborn star from the cold, outer reaches of the disk surrounding it. The theory predicts that, as these pebbles enter the warmer region closer to the star, they would release significant amounts of cold water vapor, delivering both water and solids to nascent planets."
"NASA's Webb, Hubble Combine to Create Most Colorful View of Universe","The result: A vivid landscape of galaxies along with more than a dozen newfound, time-varying objects. When two flagship observatories unite, they reveal a wealth of new details only possible through their combined power. Webb and Hubble have joined forces to study the galaxy cluster MACS0416, located about 4.3 billion light-years from Earth. Their combined data yields a prismatic panorama of blues and reds – colors that give clues to the distances of the galaxies. While the image itself is stunning, researchers are already using these observations to fuel new scientific discoveries, including the identification of gravitationally magnified supernovae and otherwise-invisible, ordinary stars."
Webb Follows Neon Signs Toward New Thinking on Planet Formation,"The contrast between the James Webb Space Telescope’s observations and those of the Spitzer Space Telescope, just 15 years ago, indicate changing conditions around a Sun-like star. In 2008 NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope found a protoplanetary disk unlike any other. The dusty disk of gas surrounding the young Sun-like star SZ Chamaeleontis (SZ Cha) was being pummeled by extreme ultraviolet radiation – something previously seen only in computer models, never in the real universe. Planets in this system would have more time to form than in a disk being evaporated by X-rays, which is the norm. However, when the James Webb Space Telescope followed up on SZ Cha, it found nothing out of the ordinary – no abundance of ultraviolet radiation. In a short space of cosmic time, conditions in SZ Cha’s disk had changed, leaving astronomers to untangle meaning from the mismatched data and its implications for the formation of other solar systems."
NASA's Webb Reveals New Features in Heart of Milky Way,"The play of darkness and light in our galaxy’s crowded core is put on display like never before. A bright field of gas sweeps around the edge of a dark, dense cloud where young stars are bursting out to take their place in the universe. They join an estimated 500,000 other stars in the scene, of various ages, sizes, and colors. It’s the hub of our Milky Way galaxy, a city center at rush hour, making our solar system’s calm corner a frontier outpost by comparison.  Discover the new features – and mysteries – NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has revealed with its unprecedented infrared-light view of the chaotic region, and what it means for astronomy."
Webb Study Reveals Rocky Planets Can Form in Extreme Environments,"Astronomers find a range of molecules that are among the building blocks for rocky planets. Space is a harsh environment, but some areas are even harsher than others. A star-forming region known as the Lobster Nebula is host to some of the most massive stars in our galaxy. Massive stars are hotter, and therefore emit more ultraviolet (UV) light. That UV light bathes planet-forming disks around nearby stars. Astronomers would expect the UV to break apart many chemical molecules. However, the James Webb Space Telescope has detected a variety of molecules in one such disk, including water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide and acetylene. Such molecules are among the building blocks of rocky planets."
NASA's Webb Stuns With New High-Definition Look at Exploded Star,"Mysterious features hide in near-infrared light Objects in space reveal different aspects of their composition and behavior at different wavelengths of light. Supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is one of the most well-studied objects in the Milky Way across the wavelength spectrum. However, there are still secrets hidden within the star’s tattered remains."
NASA's Webb Identifies Tiniest Free-Floating Brown Dwarf,"Discovery helps answer question: How small can you go when forming stars? Brown dwarfs are sometimes called failed stars, since they form like stars through gravitational collapse, but never gain enough mass to ignite nuclear fusion. The smallest brown dwarfs can overlap in mass with giant planets. In a quest to find the smallest brown dwarf, astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have found the new record-holder: an object weighing just three to four times the mass of Jupiter."
NASA's Webb Rings in the Holidays with the Ringed Planet Uranus,"New View Reveals a Strange and Dynamic Ice World When Voyager 2 flew past Uranus in 1986, the planet appeared to be a nearly featureless, solid blue ball. Now, Webb shows us an infrared view that is much more dynamic and intriguing. Rings, moons, storms, and a bright, north polar cap grace these new images. Because Uranus is tipped on its side, the polar cap appears to become more prominent as the planet’s pole points towards the Sun and receives more sunlight — a time called solstice. Uranus reaches its next solstice in 2028, and astronomers will watch for changes in the planet’s atmosphere. Studying this ice giant can help astronomers understand the formation and meteorology of similarly sized planets around other suns."
NASA's Webb Finds Signs of Possible Aurorae on Isolated Brown Dwarf,"Infrared emission from methane suggests atmospheric heating by auroral processes. Astronomers using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope have found a brown dwarf (an object more massive than Jupiter but smaller than a star) that may display possible aurorae, like the familiar Northern Lights on our world. This is an unexpected mystery because the brown dwarf, known as W1935, is an isolated object in space, with no nearby star to create an aurora."
NASA's Webb Discovers Dusty 'Cat's Tail' in Beta Pictoris System,"New observations in infrared light suggest recent massive collision. Since the 1980s, the planetary system around the star Beta Pictoris has continued to fascinate scientists. Even after decades of study, it still holds surprises."
"Webb Shows Many Early Galaxies Looked Like Pool Noodles, Surfboards","Hang Ten! Researchers using Webb found that many distant galaxies have flattened oval disk and tube-like shapes, not spiral or elliptical structures. Ready to hit the cosmic “waves” with the James Webb Space Telescope? Like a lifeguard on duty, Webb has scanned the horizon and spotted distant galaxies shaped like volleyballs, frisbees, pool noodles, and surfboards."
NASA's Webb Depicts Staggering Structure in 19 Nearby Spiral Galaxies,"A new treasure trove of Webb images has arrived! Near- and mid-infrared images show off every facet of these face-on spiral galaxies. Humanity has spent centuries mapping Earth’s features – and we frequently repeat the process by using more advanced instruments. When we combine the data, we get a more complete understanding of our planet."
Webb Finds Evidence for Neutron Star at Heart of Young Supernova Remnant,"Astronomers detect long-sought compact object within the remnant of Supernova 1987A. In February 1987, the closest supernova to earth in almost 400 years exploded onto the scene. Designated Supernova 1987A (SN 1987A), it resulted from the death of a massive star in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a dwarf galaxy 160,000 light-years away. In the decades since, its remnant has been studied by telescopes at all wavelengths of light from X-rays to radio. Yet despite all the scrutiny, one mystery has remained."
Webb Unlocks Secrets of One of the Most Distant Galaxies Ever Seen,"The enigmatic galaxy GN-z11 is one of the youngest ever observed. Delivering on its promise to transform our understanding of the early universe, the James Webb Space Telescope is probing galaxies near the dawn of time. One of these is the exceptionally luminous galaxy GN-z11, which existed when the universe was just a tiny fraction of its current age. One of the youngest and most distant galaxies ever observed, it is also one of the most enigmatic. Why is it so bright? Webb appears to have found the answer."
What Are Hubble and Webb Observing Right Now? NASA Tool Has the Answer,"NASA's Space Telescope Live provides an interactive way to explore the most accurate, up-to-date, publicly available information on current, past, and upcoming observations by NASA’s Hubble and Webb space telescopes.

Peering Into the Tendrils of NGC 604 with NASA's Webb,"Unique opportunity to study high concentration of massive, young stars nearby In the astronomy field, the term “nearby” is quite relative. Neighboring galaxies to our home galaxy, the Milky Way, are a few million light-years away. In contrast, some of the most distant galaxies ever detected, closer to the Big Bang, are billions of light-years away. In some cases, the ability to study nearby objects at an extremely high resolution can help astronomers better understand more distant objects."
"NASA's Webb, Hubble Telescopes Affirm Universe's Expansion Rate, Puzzle Persists","Webb measurements shed new light on a decade-long mystery. One of the three scientific justifications to the U.S. Congress for building the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its observing power to give an exact value for the expansion rate of the universe. Prior to Hubble’s 1990 launch, observations from ground-based telescopes yielded huge uncertainties. Depending on the expansion rate, the universe could be anywhere between 10 to 20 billion years old. For the past 34 years Hubble has shrunken this value to an accuracy approaching one percent. This has been accomplished by refining the so-called “cosmic distance ladder” by measuring the gold standard of cosmic milepost markers known as Cepheid variable stars."
"Cheers! NASA's Webb Finds Ethanol, Other Icy Ingredients for Worlds",Newfound carbon-containing molecules are key ingredients for potentially habitable planets. Stars and their planets form from swirling clouds of gas and dust enriched with chemical elements and compounds from previous generations of stars. One long-standing question in astronomy is: How ubiquitous are the elements crucial to life as we know it?
NASA's Webb Probes an Extreme Starburst Galaxy,"Amid a site teeming with new and young stars lies an intricate substructure. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has set its sights on the starburst galaxy Messier 82 (M82), a small but mighty environment that features rapid star formation. By looking closer with Webb’s sensitive infrared capabilities, a team of scientists is getting to the very core of the galaxy: gaining a better understanding of how it is forming stars, and how this extreme activity is affecting the galaxy as a whole."
